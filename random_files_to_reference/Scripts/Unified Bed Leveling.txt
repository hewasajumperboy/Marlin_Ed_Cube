Unified Bed Leveling:

Examples

This is a minimal sequence for set-up and initial probing of a UBL mesh on a machine that includes a display and z-probe

G28           ; Home XYZ.
G29 P1        ; Do automated probing of the bed.
G29 P3        ; Smart Fill Repeat until all mesh points are filled in, Used to fill unreachable points.
G29 S0        ; Save UBL mesh points to slot 0 (EEPROM).
G29 F 10.0    ; Set Fade Height for correction at 10.0 mm.
G29 A         ; Activate the UBL System.
M500          ; Save current setup. WARNING - UBL will be active at power up, before any G28.

This is a minimal sequence for set-up and initial probing of a UBL mesh on a machine that includes a display and no z-probe

G28           ; Home XYZ.
G29 P4 R255   ; Do manual probing of the bed.
G29 S0        ; Save UBL mesh points to slot 0 (EEPROM).
G29 F 10.0    ; Set Fade Height for correction at 10.0 mm.
G29 A         ; Activate the UBL System.
M500          ; Save current setup. WARNING - UBL will be active at power up, before any G28.

Optional settings

M502          ; Load configuration defaults.
M500          ; Save configuration to EEPROM. M502 followed by M500 is suggested post flash to wipe the eeprom of invalid old settings.

M190 S65      ; Heat Bed to 65C. Not required, but having the printer at temperature may help accuracy.
M104 S210     ; Heat Hotend to 210C. Not required, but having the printer at temperature may help accuracy.

G29 T         ; View the Z compensation values.
G29 P2 B T    ; Manually probe unreachable points. Requires an LCD controller.

Use G26 and G29 commands to fine-tune a measured mesh

G26 C P T3.0  ; Produce mesh validation pattern with primed nozzle. G26 is optional; any bed leveling stl would also work.
    ; NOTE - PLA temperatures are assumed unless you specify - e.g. - B 105 H 225 for ABS Plastic
G29 P4 T      ; Move nozzle to 'bad' areas and fine tune the values if needed.
    ; Repeat G26 and G29 P4 T  commands as needed.
G29 S0        ; Save UBL mesh values to EEPROM.
M500          ; Resave UBL's state information.

Tilt a stored mesh; e.g. in your startup script

G29 L0        ; Load the mesh stored in slot 0 (from G29 S0)
G29 J         ; Probe 3 points and tilt the mesh according to what it finds, optionally G29 J2 would do 4 points.
